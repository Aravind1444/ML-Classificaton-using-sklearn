# Machine-Learning-Classificaton-using-scikit-learn
This repository contains the code for a machine learning classifier. I've used three types of scaling methods and three classifiers in this.
The Scaling methods used in this code is :
1) Standard scaler
2) MinMax Scaler
3) NormalizerThis repository contains the code for a machine learning classifier. I've used three types of scaling methods and three classifiers in this.

The three classifers used in this code are:
1) Support Vector Machine with 'gamma' set to 'auto'
2) Support Vector Machine with Kernel= polynomial, and of second degree
3) Random Forest

The data used for training and Classification is Breast Cancer Data Set.
